# Ansible tips

1) --step
This is the simplest of the techniques to implement and follow. Just add --step to your ansible-playbook command,

2) Inline logging
In addition to runtime control, you can use old-fashioned log lines to help determine whatâ€™s going on

3) Run ansible-lint

4) Run ansible-console
This can be a huge timesaver when developing your Ansible code

5) The Ansible Debugger
Ansible also contains a debugger that you can use to interrogate a running Ansible process.
